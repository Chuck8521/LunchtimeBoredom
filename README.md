# LunchtimeBoredom
Code I wrote during my lunch periods throughout junior year. General programming problems and some interesting stuff. New repository coming soon for new projects!

Feel free to suggest ideas for projects, solving the same kind of problems gets old fast.

Also, what do you mean by this mystical "GUI"? Console text is the way to go!

NOTE: The maze.txt file is for use with SearchAlgorithms.java. It is simply an example file and can be changed however you want so long as format is constant.

ADDITIONAL NOTE: The UltimateAI.cs file uses the Unity engine and associated libraries. It is purely meant as a backup file and does not run independently in any way.
