# LunchtimeBoredom
Code I wrote (mainly) during my lunch periods throughout the year. General programming problems and some interesting stuff to come.

Feel free to suggest ideas for projects, solving the same kind of problems gets old fast.

Also, what do you mean by this mystical "GUI"? Console text is the way to go!
